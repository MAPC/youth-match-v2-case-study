								<h2>Meeting Boston Youth Where They're At</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Summer jobs for youth aged 16–19, continue to decline across the country and do so at much higher rates for low-income Black and Latino youth. Despite that trend, researchers have found a remarkably positive correlation between having a summer job and achieving better long-term life outcomes (reduced incarceration rates and higher educational achievement).</p>
							<p>Though these positive outcomes have been demonstrated in study after study, there are a host of barriers to entry and bottlenecks to successfully employing youth. Which is why, in 2015, a team of data and technology experts formed a coalition of unlikely collaborators known as Boston’s Civic Tech Data Collaborative. Funded nationally and tasked with designing an innovative approach to improve the youth workforce development system in the City of Boston — the group successfully designed and piloted a youth jobs platform to change the way the City provides teens with a summer job offer.</p>

								<h2>Improving the Experience for Youth, End-to-End</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Designing appropriate technology for youth didn’t stop with considering the preferences young people have, the team also investigated communications patterns of this particular demographic. Researching communication patterns revealed that teens primarily use text over email to communicate: in 2015, Pew reported that 55% of teens text message as a form of communication with friends every day, almost twice as much as speaking in person or by phone, and nearly 6x’s as more frequently as emailing socially.</p>
							<p>The team pivoted away from emailing youth offers toward a text-driven strategy. What we saw was outstanding: acceptance rates without human intervention shot up and the overall number of teens hired, fared well too.</p>

								<h2>Making better matches: Algorithmic design and routing technology</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The technical leads on the project, from Metropolitan Area Planning Council’s Digital Service Team, led the development of the Youth Jobs Platform. Initially the team sought to improve the matching process itself by redesigning the process behind a summer jobs lottery. They did so by adapting a highly effective matching algorithm called “Gale-Shapely” method which solves a classic economic problem called the stable marriage problem, which ensures a stable match (repeatable and reliable) between two equally sized sets of data (in this case jobs and youth applicants). Gale-Shapely was invented to address matching medical students to residency programs in hospitals across the country. In this case, the algorithm was used to better match youth to jobs that they wanted and could reach.</p>

					<p>The Youth Jobs Platform was built through a partnership between the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC, Boston’s Regional Planning Agency), the City of Boston Division of Youth Engagement and Employment (DYEE) and Department Innovation & Technology (DoIT), local volunteer-based civic technologists (Code for Boston), the Boston Foundation, and faculty researchers at MIT.</p>
					<p>The Civic Tech and Data Collaborative (CTDC) is a joint initiative of Living Cities, Code for America and the National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership, supported by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Locally in Boston, this project was generously supported by BNY Mellon..</p>
